CTBNCToolkit
============

Continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are designed for temporal classification of multivariate streaming data when time duration of events matters and the class does not change over time. CTBNCToolkit is an open source Java toolkit which provides a stand-alone application for temporal classification and a library for continuous time Bayesian network classifiers.

CTBNCToolkit can be used for scientific purposes, such as model comparison and temporal classification of interesting scientific problems, but it can be used as well as a prototype to address real world problems.

CTBNCToolkit was built at [MAD laboratory](http://www.mad.disco.unimib.it/), mainly by [Daniele Codecasa](http://www.linkedin.com/in/codecasa/en) as part of his Ph.D. thesis.
